# Configuration pages

For the shared Save action, read [Saving configuration](../reference/saving.md).

One file per page, at the path of the page under `src/rfsuite/app/pages/` with `.md`
appended: the page `setup/power/smartfuel/page.lua` is documented in
`docs/pages/setup/power/smartfuel.md`. Menu entries that only open a submenu have no file.

**Status:** 93 reachable pages, 24 written. 73 of them carry an in-app help text behind the
`?` in the header, which is the text to start a page file from; the others start from the
page source.

The *Conditions* column names what hides, greys out or locks a page; the sentences to use in
a page file are in [_template.md](../_template.md), and the mechanics are explained in
[reference/](../reference/README.md) (`hidden-and-locked-pages.md`, to write).

## Not documented on purpose

Page directories that exist in the source but cannot be reached from the menu, and therefore
get no file: `settings/shortcuts` (its entry is disabled and hidden), `settings/activelook`
and `settings/dashboard/page.lua` (not registered), and `tools/diagnostics/fblsensors` (its
entry is commented out in the manifest). If one of them is wired up, it gets a file then.
