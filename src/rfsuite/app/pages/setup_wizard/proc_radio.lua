-- already -- the board is told that arming sits on an aux slot, and the radio is told which switch
-- drives which channel -- but nothing today makes the two agree, and a mode configured on a
-- channel no switch reaches looks perfectly configured on its own page.
--
-- The completion criterion of a channel procedure is therefore the END-TO-END, not the half: the
-- mix is present AND the flight controller carries the matching entry. Neither alone is done.
--
-- Every visible string goes through `t(i18n, key, fallback)` with a literal key and a literal
-- one-line fallback, and this file carries its own `pageT` call. That is not style: the build
-- resolves those three things into the locale's own text and leaves anything else as the English

-- 8 -- the transmitter link, and it is the strongest case on this path for the assistant existing
-- at all: BOTH sides of this setting are on one screen here and nowhere else.
--
-- The flight controller does not measure the link. It carries a DECLARATION of it --
-- `crsf_telemetry_link_rate` and `_link_ratio` -- and paces every telemetry frame it emits out of
-- a token bucket computed from that pair. Declared faster than the link runs and the board
-- schedules more than the link drains: backlog, dropped frames, values that are stale rather than
-- absent. Declared slower and the bandwidth is simply left unused. Both read as *telemetry is
-- laggy* and neither is an error anywhere.
--
-- Nothing here is new machinery. The suite already walks the module's parameter tree, classifies
-- the packet rate and telemetry ratio fields by name, and writes either side to match the other;
-- and `lib/crsf.lua` multiplexes the frames, so this conversation and the MSP one do not eat each
-- other's replies. This procedure drives that task and shows what it found.
--
-- ON ARMING: every frame pushed to the module replaces one RC channel frame for that cycle, so
-- this must not run while the craft is armed. It is not re-tested here, and the reason has
-- changed. `lockedWhileArmed` answers whether the assistant may be ENTERED, which leaves a
-- procedure that was already open across the arming edge with its rows live; and a page no
-- longer has to write a second, weaker test, because lib/armed.lua publishes the same predicate
-- the header's own Save uses. What covers the three rows below is the task itself: it refuses a
-- write while armed, at the one point every one of its callers passes through.

-- NOT here, and the reason is the assistant's own entry gate: choosing between the internal and
-- the external module and switching one ON. `model.setModule` can do both -- it takes the module
-- type and goes through the firmware's own `setModuleType` -- but the moment such a write lands,
-- the link to this flight controller is gone, and a module the pilot has just enabled is bound to
-- nothing. The assistant is reachable only WITH a flight controller connected, which is exactly
-- the state in which that choice must not be made. It belongs to a procedure that runs before
-- there is a link, and that is a different entry point rather than a screen missing from this one.
