  -- Both are `widget` rather than `both`, and that is about WHO MAY WRITE TO THE PILOT'S MODEL.
  -- These two are the only tasks here that reach outside the suite: they rename the radio's model
  -- and they write its timers and global variables. That is background work -- it belongs to
  -- whatever is running while the pilot flies, which is the dashboard and the service widget. The
  -- tool is a configurator, opened deliberately and closed again, and a model that changes because
  -- somebody looked at a settings page is a surprise nobody asked for.
  --
  -- It also removes a duplicate. Run in both contexts, the same rename is attempted twice per
  -- connect from two Lua states that cannot see each other's module state.
