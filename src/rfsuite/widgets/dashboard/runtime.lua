-- lua_widget.cpp), so a pass that overruns its slot costs the NEXT slots rather than running
-- twice, and every gap is a multiple of that period. Two slots in a row is ordinary on a busy
-- start-up; a hole this long is what anything timed from a pass overruns by, and on this widget
-- the shortest deadline of the lot is the in-flight overlay's value pulse.
local PASS_GAP_REPORT = 0.15

-- Which shared-memory slot carries this widget's heartbeat, and how the two figures are packed
-- into the one integer it holds.
--
-- **The map of the sixteen slots is in tasks/events/telemetry_bg/drain.lua**, which allocates
-- them; these are literals rather than a read of that module because nothing on this pass loads
-- it and pulling in the decoder's subtree for two constants would cost more than the feature.
-- Keeping them in step is therefore a manual obligation, and the map is the authority.
--
-- The wrap stays far inside the firmware's `int`: `shmVar` is a plain C int array
-- (radio/src/lua/api_general.cpp), so the packed value must not reach 2^31. It also never lands
-- on zero, because a slot that was never written reads zero and a writer that produced one would
-- be indistinguishable from that.

--- Report how much of the per-pass instruction ceiling this widget is consuming.
--
-- EdgeTX gives the widget Lua state a fixed instruction budget per pass, and
-- LuaWidget::foreground (radio/src/lua/lua_widget.cpp) runs this widget's refresh() AND the
-- LVGL reactive-reference sweep callRefs() inside one protected block on that one budget. It
-- stores the share consumed once both have returned, and getUsage() hands exactly that value
-- back for an LVGL widget (luaGetUsage, radio/src/lua/api_general.cpp). So the figure readable
-- here is the PREVIOUS pass's, refresh and sweep together -- which is why it is sampled at the
-- top of a pass, where the object count still describes the tree that sweep walked.
--
-- Past the budget the firmware raises "CPU limit" from inside the sweep, paints its own message
-- over the widget and stops calling refresh() altogether, so the pass that fails can never
-- report itself and no line here can be the failing one. What this gives a bug report is the
-- approach to it, and the point at which the reporting stopped.
--
-- Three figures, because each of them alone misleads. The current sample says what a settled
-- widget costs. The peak over the interval says how close the worst pass in that stretch came,
-- which is the number that decides whether the ceiling gets crossed on a busier screen. The peak
-- since load keeps the worst pass of a session from scrolling out of a card log.
--
-- The value is not bounded by 100: the firmware's hook switches to a per-line mask once the count
-- is up and keeps counting until the raise lands, so an overrunning pass reports what it cost.
-- It is held in a uint8_t, though, so a pass past 255 wraps and reads low -- one more reason to
-- report a stream of figures rather than a single worst one, since a wrapped sample stands out
-- among its neighbours and would silently become the record on its own.
--
-- Nothing here tests the debug level. Log.emitf does that, and below "trace" the line is neither
-- printed, nor put in the session ring, nor written to the card.

  -- one. What says it stopped is that the counter below stops moving, and only something outside
  -- this state can see that -- the shared-memory slots are the one channel there is.
  --
  -- A moving counter rather than a flag, and never zero: nothing clears the slots, not a model
  -- change and not the interpreter being torn down, so a flag left set by a state that has gone
  -- away would mislead for as long as the radio is on, and a slot that was never written reads
  -- zero. It counts PASSES rather than saying "I am alive", which is also what makes it the rate
  -- a reader wants: the difference between two samples over the time between them is the pass
  -- rate, and a widget at twelve per cent of budget and thirty passes a second is a different
  -- machine from one at twelve per cent and four.
  --
  -- The gate is sampled on the report window below and cached, not asked per pass: this is a
  -- diagnostic, it belongs behind the debug level like every other, and asking the preferences
  -- for it thirty times a second would be the diagnostic becoming the cost.
  -- Sampled once on the first pass and then on the report window below. Without the first
  -- sample the heartbeat would not start until five seconds in -- and a widget that dies inside

--- What the preference files look like right now, or nil where that could not be established.
--
-- The difference between those two is the point. A file that could not be READ is not a file
-- that CHANGED, and the caller compares this string against the one it kept -- so a failed read
-- that returns a shorter string turns "I could not look" into "the per-model file is gone". The
-- reload that answers it re-reads the preferences, drops the theme and rebuilds the scene; and
-- when the file reads again the string grows back, which is reported as a second change.
--
-- Four conditions used to be swallowed that way: an `fstat` that raises and one that answers
-- something `stampOf` cannot read, for each of the two files. The global pair left the stamp an
-- empty string, the per-model pair dropped its half. Each of the four is a failure to measure,
-- and a failure to measure is now nil -- which the caller already treats as "no comparison this
-- pass". That costs nothing: the next pass looks again a second later.
--
-- A nil `modelPath` is deliberately NOT one of them. It says the session has no per-model file,
-- which is a fact about the model rather than a failed read, and the stamp is then the global
-- half alone.
--- One preference file's stamp, or the stamp of the file it is brought across from where the
--- former has not been written yet.
--
-- A card written by an earlier release carries only the file in the previous format, and this
-- widget is not the one that brings it across: that costs more instructions than a widget call
-- is allowed, so it belongs to the configuration tool and to the background decoder. Stamping
-- only the current name would therefore leave nothing to compare on such a card -- and, worse,
-- would take the FIRST stamp after the migration, which the caller reads as a baseline rather
-- than as the change it is. The two files have different sizes, so the swap moves the stamp.
--
-- The second call is made only when the first misses, so a card that has already been brought
-- across pays exactly one fstat per file, as before.
