-- Reporting only when the figure RISES was the obvious shape and it is the wrong one: a widget

-- states its number once and is then silent for the rest of the session. A fixed interval keeps a
-- current figure in the log for as long as the widget is alive, and it gives the end of the lines
-- a meaning they otherwise do not have: a widget that has stopped reporting has stopped
-- refreshing.

--- Report how much of the per-pass instruction ceiling this widget is consuming.
--
-- EdgeTX gives the widget Lua state a fixed instruction budget per pass, and
-- LuaWidget::foreground (radio/src/lua/lua_widget.cpp) runs this widget's refresh() AND the
-- LVGL reactive-reference sweep callRefs() inside one protected block on that one budget. It
-- stores the share consumed once both have returned, and getUsage() hands exactly that value
-- back for an LVGL widget (luaGetUsage, radio/src/lua/api_general.cpp). So the figure readable
-- here is the PREVIOUS pass's, refresh and sweep together -- which is why it is sampled at the
-- top of a pass, where the object count still describes the tree that sweep walked.
--
-- Past the budget the firmware raises "CPU limit" from inside the sweep, paints its own message
-- over the widget and stops calling refresh() altogether, so the pass that fails can never
-- report itself and no line here can be the failing one. What this gives a bug report is the
-- approach to it, and the point at which the reporting stopped.
--
-- Three figures, because each of them alone misleads. The current sample says what a settled
-- widget costs. The peak over the interval says how close the worst pass in that stretch came,
-- which is the number that decides whether the ceiling gets crossed on a busier screen. The peak
-- since load keeps the worst pass of a session from scrolling out of a card log.
--
-- The value is not bounded by 100: the firmware's hook switches to a per-line mask once the count
-- is up and keeps counting until the raise lands, so an overrunning pass reports what it cost.
-- It is held in a uint8_t, though, so a pass past 255 wraps and reads low -- one more reason to
-- report a stream of figures rather than a single worst one, since a wrapped sample stands out
-- among its neighbours and would silently become the record on its own.
--
-- Nothing here tests the debug level. Log.emitf does that, and below "trace" the line is neither
-- printed, nor put in the session ring, nor written to the card.

--- What the preference files look like right now: size and mtime, as one string.

--
-- FAT stores mtime at two-second granularity and depends on the RTC, so two writes inside
-- one second can share a timestamp. That is why the size is part of the stamp.
-- `fstat` returns the modification time as a TABLE -- year, mon, day, hour, min, sec and more
-- (radio/src/lua/api_filesystem.cpp) -- not as a number. `tostring()` on it is therefore a table
-- ADDRESS, which is different on every call, so a stamp built that way never equals the previous
-- one and a comparison against it reports a change every single time.
--
